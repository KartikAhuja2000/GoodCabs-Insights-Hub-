Codebasics Resume Challenge #13: Transportation Domain Insights
In this project, I tackled Resume Challenge 13 by Codebasics, where I analyzed transportation data and provided actionable insights for the Chief of Operations. The goal was to evaluate key performance metrics, identify trends, and recommend strategies for improving operations in the transportation sector.

Observations & Recommendations:

High-Performing Cities: Jaipur, Chandigarh, and Kochi show strong performance in trips, revenue, and retention.

Underperforming Cities: Surat and Lucknow need targeted strategies to improve performance.

Seasonality: Investigating the reasons behind the drop in trips from April to June is essential to optimize performance.

Areas for Improvement:

Negative Revenue Cities: Vadodara and Mysore require immediate attention to address negative revenue trends.

Trip Target Shortfall: Despite strong overall performance, Good Cabs showed slight underperformance against its target.

This project sharpened my analytical skills and enhanced my ability to draw business insights using Power BI for data visualization. The live dashboard and code are available in this repository.
