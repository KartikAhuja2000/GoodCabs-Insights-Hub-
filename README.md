Observations & Recommendations:

High-Performing Cities: Jaipur, Chandigarh, and Kochi show strong performance in trips, revenue, and retention.

Underperforming Cities: Surat and Lucknow need targeted strategies to improve performance.

Seasonality: Investigating the reasons behind the drop in trips from April to June is essential to optimize performance.

Areas for Improvement:

Trip Target Shortfall: Despite strong overall performance, Good Cabs showed slight underperformance against its target.

This project sharpened my analytical skills and enhanced my ability to draw business insights using Power BI for data visualization. The live dashboard and code are available in this repository.
